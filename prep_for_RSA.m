% Simon RSA work. Started September 16, 2021    
% 
% Start with the PCA that was done
%
% 1) calculate the distance between the 400 items for which there are x and y values
% 
% 2) fill out the missing items with NaN rows/columns (so it has the same dimensions as one of the other RDMs)
% 
% 3) add in the IDs (remember all RDM nat files gave both the RDM and the IDs)
% 
% And then 4) run Benâ€™s script

% see mds_practice.m for a continuation of this work


%%
% For MDS_for_R
% Columns are: i, item, category, WC_category, ID, Title_category, domain, size, MeanD, NoF, col of 1s for some reason, cosine_X, cosine_Y, and then many many 
% 
% For the participant-specific tabs
% Columns are: [blank], ID, concept, MDSX, MDSY, ConcMem, Mem, beta_image, beta2

% for sure I will make sure we're making higher numbers mean similarity so
% it matches the data I saw in RSA_class_6.9
% That means my RDM has to be flipped with (1 - Euc Dist) and then I'll
% flip my PCA as well so it'll have lower numbers to reflect the lack of
% similarity between items
